# PAYDAY 2 Model Tool - Calcium Edition

This is a copy of IAmNotASpy and PoueT's model tool, with a bunch of new features:

* Greatly improved UI, with different functions cleanly separated
* The ability to use an XML-based script to modify the object/bone structure of models, and create entirely
new models without deriving them from an existing model, and set rootpoints for different objects
* Experimental Collada (DAE) and Filmbox (FBX) export support, for bones and (in the latter case) full
rigging, vertex colours, and eight UV channel support.
* An importer for Filmbox (Coming Soonâ„¢)
* And a bunch of miscellaneous features and bugfixes
